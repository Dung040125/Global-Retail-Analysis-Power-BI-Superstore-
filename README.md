## Introduction & Objectives
Superstore requires a visual tool for Senior Management to grasp the business situation, identify growth opportunities, and select strategic products. This project develops an interactive Power BI dashboard to address core business questions regarding sales performance, market trends, and product portfolio management, thereby supporting strategic decisions for market expansion.

---
## Dataset & Preprocessing
-   **Dataset:** Superstore's global sales data (2011-2014) comprising three tables: `Orders` (transaction details), `People` (sales personnel), and `Returns` (returned transactions).
    -   Source: Superstore sample dataset.
    -   Schema Details: Available in original data files.
-   **Preprocessing (Power Query):**
    -   Connected and cleaned data (handled missing values, standardized data types).
    -   Built a data model, establishing relationships between tables.
    -   Created calculated columns and measures using DAX for analysis (e.g., `Return Rate %`, `Sales Growth YoY`).

---
## Methodology & Tools
-   **Design Thinking Process:**
    -   Applied Design Thinking methodology to deeply understand stakeholder (Senior Management) needs and current challenges.
    -   Identified key business questions and critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track.
    -   The entire Design Thinking process and its outcomes are documented in detail in the Excel file included in the project deliverables.

-   **Dashboard Development:**
    1.  **Tools:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop, Microsoft Excel (for Design Thinking).
    2.  **Language:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
    3.  **Process:** Data loading and processing -> Data modeling -> DAX measure development -> Design and construction of interactive dashboard pages.
    4.  Detailed insights and recommendations are compiled and presented in the Design Thinking file (see Project Deliverables).

## Key Insights & Recommendations
Below is a summary of key actionable insights and recommendations derived from the dashboard (more details in the Design Thinking file):

**1. Overall Business Health:**
*   **Insight:** Substantial total sales (12.64M), but YoY growth shows volatility, slowing significantly in early 2013. The Central region is a major contributor but shows slowing growth.
*   **Recommendation:** Investigate causes of slowing growth, especially in the Central region. Monitor and address spikes in return rates.

**2. Product Strategy:**
*   **Insight:** High-revenue products (e.g., Apple Smart Phone) are not always the most profitable (Canon ImageCLASS leads). The Technology category has high sales but also a high return rate (~11%).
*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize high-profit products. Reduce return rates in the Technology category. Balance portfolio with stable and high-growth/high-risk products.

**3. Market Opportunities:**
*   **Insight:** The large Central region shows negative growth. Oceania demonstrates positive growth. North Asia is a potential emerging market.
*   **Recommendation:** Retain market share in large markets (Central). Invest in growth markets (Oceania, North Asia). Tailor product assortment regionally.

**4. Managing Return Risk:**
*   **Insight:** Furniture has the highest return rate (11.87%). High-value items (e.g., Cisco) have a significant financial impact when returned.
*   **Recommendation:** Prioritize addressing returns for high financial impact items. Analyze frequent returns of low-value items. Reduce return rates in Furniture and Technology.
